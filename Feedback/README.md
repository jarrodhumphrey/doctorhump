# Feedback Collection Project

## Project Purpose
Extract testimonials, quotes, statistics, and evidence demonstrating Dr. Hump's excellence in teaching and presenting AI-related content. This material will be used for the doctorhump.com personal brand website.

## Project Scope
This folder contains feedback artifacts from various sources including:
- Student evaluations and feedback forms
- Event presentation surveys and responses
- Email testimonials
- Screenshots of social media/platform feedback
- Academic manuscripts and publications
- Panel discussion documentation

## Extraction Goals
For each artifact, extract:
1. **Key quotes** - Direct testimonials about teaching effectiveness, AI expertise, presentation quality
2. **Statistics** - Ratings, percentages, numerical evidence of impact
3. **Context** - Who said it, when, what event/course/presentation
4. **Impact statements** - Specific outcomes or transformations mentioned

## CRITICAL: Anonymization Requirements

**All feedback must be anonymized for website use.**

### Anonymization Guidelines:
- **Xavier University President** → "Xavier University President" or "University President"
- **Xavier Administrators/Deans** → "Xavier Administrator" or "Department Dean"
- **Xavier Faculty** → "Xavier Faculty Member" or "Xavier Professor"
- **Xavier Students (MBA/EMBA)** → "MBA Student" or "EMBA Student"
- **Xavier Students (Undergrad)** → "Xavier Student" or "Undergraduate Student"
- **External Organizations** → Keep organization name if relevant (e.g., "GE Project Manager")
- **Personal names** → NEVER include in extracted quotes or testimonials

### Attribution Format:
- Quote text (exact)
- Source role (anonymized)
- Context (course/event name, date/year if relevant)
- Example: *"This was the most impactful presentation on AI I've experienced."* — EMBA Student, Fall 2024

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Inventory & Categorization
1. Create comprehensive inventory of all feedback items
2. Categorize by type (course feedback, event feedback, emails, publications, etc.)
3. Categorize by source (Xavier, external organizations, students, peers, etc.)
4. Add chronological information where available
5. Propose organized folder structure

### Phase 2: Extraction
1. Process each document type systematically
2. Extract multiple highlights per file when valuable
3. Document exact quotes with attribution
4. Capture quantitative data (ratings, survey results, etc.)
5. Note visual elements from screenshots that demonstrate impact

### Phase 3: Organization
1. Reorganize files into logical folder structure
2. Create categorized collections (by topic, by year, by source type)
3. Cross-reference related materials
4. Create master testimonials document

### Phase 4: Website Integration
1. Select strongest quotes for website display
2. Organize by brand pillar (AI expertise primarily)
3. Format for web presentation
4. Maintain source documentation for verification

## Document Types Present

### High-Value PDFs (Multi-page reflections/compilations)
- **EMBA Reflections**: Detailed student reflections (12+ pages) with multiple quotes per student
- **Survey Results**: Presentation feedback with statistics and written responses
- **Email Compilations**: Multiple emails or threaded conversations
- **Manuscripts**: Academic research drafts with citations

### Single-Item PDFs
- **Individual Emails**: Single email testimonials from students, administrators, peers
- **Talk Summaries**: Presentation feedback forms

### Images (PNG/JPG)
- **Email Screenshots**: Quick testimonials captured as images
- **Panel Photos**: Visual documentation of speaking engagements
- **Social Media**: Platform feedback screenshots

### Word Docs (.docx)
- **Email Compilations**: Collected correspondence
- **Manuscript Drafts**: Research papers with feedback data
- **Reddit/Social Compilations**: Community feedback

### Extraction Strategy by Type:
1. **Multi-page PDFs**: Extract 2-4 best quotes, note total participant count
2. **Single emails**: Extract 1-2 key quotes with sender title/role
3. **Images**: Transcribe key quote and context
4. **Survey PDFs**: Extract statistics AND representative quotes

## Output Documents
- `inventory.md` - Complete catalog of all feedback items
- `testimonials-extracted.md` - All extracted quotes and statistics
- `website-ready.md` - Curated selection for website use
- Organized subfolders (TBD based on analysis)

## Sample Analysis Insights

### Key Patterns Discovered:
1. **Volume varies dramatically**: Single-quote emails vs 12-page multi-student reflections
2. **Hierarchy of sources**: University president > Department heads > Students > Peers
3. **Recency matters**: Most recent feedback (2024) shows ongoing teaching excellence
4. **Student outcomes**: Many mention specific AI implementations post-training
5. **Technical depth**: Students cite specific concepts (LLMs, prompt engineering, hype cycle)

### Strongest Quote Types:
- Direct comparisons ("favorite professor")
- Leadership endorsements (President, Dean)
- Measurable outcomes ("created three AI agents")
- Specific technical learning ("understanding LLMs", "prompt techniques")
- Behavioral change ("I plan to use AI for...")
