## Files Remaining to Process

### 1. Reddit_AI.docx
**File Type:** Word document (.docx)
**Expected Content:** Likely compilation of Reddit posts/discussions about AI
**Challenge:** Binary format - Read tool cannot process .docx files directly

### 2. XU_MBA_Feedback.docx
**File Type:** Word document (.docx)
**Expected Content:** MBA student feedback (likely additional testimonials beyond EMBA reflections)
**Challenge:** Binary format - Read tool cannot process .docx files directly

## How to Process These Files (Future Instructions)

### Option 1: Convert to PDF First (Recommended)
1. Open each .docx file in Microsoft Word
2. File → Save As → PDF
3. Save as same filename with .pdf extension
4. Use Read tool on new PDF files
5. Extract testimonials using same format as other files in this folder

### Option 2: Manual Extraction
1. Open .docx files manually in Word
2. Read content and manually copy key quotes
3. Add to EXTRACTED-TESTIMONIALS.md following existing format
4. Update file count from 7/9 to 9/9

### Option 3: Skip for Now
- Current extraction already has 25+ testimonials from 17 files
- These 2 files likely contain additional supportive evidence
- May not be critical if sufficient testimonials already gathered
- Consider priority based on website needs

## When to Come Back to This

**Process these files if:**
- Need more Reddit/social media validation quotes
- Need additional MBA (non-EMBA) student testimonials
- Creating comprehensive "all feedback" master document
- Have extra time during Phase 3 (Website Integration)

**Skip these files if:**
- Already have sufficient testimonials for website (currently 25+)
- Time-constrained and need to move to website design
- Reddit content doesn't align with professional brand positioning

- "Four friends" framework ✅
- Cross-campus partnerships ✅
- Statistical evidence (surveys) ✅

**What These 2 Remaining Files Might Add:**

- Possible duplicate content with already-processed files

---

## Recommendation for Future Work

**Priority: LOW**

The 7 files already processed provide:
- Comprehensive testimonials (25+ quotes)
- Statistical validation (100% NPS, 9.8/10)
- Executive education proof (EMBA, Fortune 500)
- Institutional partnerships
- Academic credentials

Unless the remaining 2 .docx files contain uniquely valuable content (like major media coverage or external corporate partnerships), the current extraction is likely sufficient for website purposes.

**Suggested Action:** Move to Phase 3 (creating master testimonials compilation and website-ready selection) with current 17 files. Return to these 2 files only if gaps identified during website content creation.
