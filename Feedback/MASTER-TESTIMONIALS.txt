14. "Dr. Humphrey's lecture on AI in business was an enlightening experience that provided both theoretical and practical knowledge. His insights into generative AI, productivity enhancements, and prompting techniques were invaluable, offering a solid foundation for understanding AI's potential and limitations." — EMBA Student, November 2024

15. "Jarrod Humphrey's lecture on artificial intelligence was illuminating and extremely interesting." — EMBA Student, November 2024

16. "I was very much looking forward to Jarrod's presentation, and he did not disappoint! I use AI somewhat regularly in my day-to-day work, and I still feel like I took a few concepts away." — EMBA Student, November 2024

17. "One thing I found amazing was the four different reasons Jarrod suggested using artificial intelligence: the 'learning luminary,' 'brainstorming buddy,' 'correspondence calculator,' and 'data decoder.' I've used AI for all of these purposes, but have never found such a useful model for describing many of the use cases for AI." — EMBA Student, November 2024

18. "Jarrod's breakdown of AI's 'four friends:' correspondence, idea generation, data analysis, and learning, provided a practical roadmap for different applications." — EMBA Student, November 2024

19. "One of the most impactful points was how AI can be a significant productivity booster. For instance, the research discussed in the presentation demonstrated how consultants using AI completed tasks faster and with higher quality than those without AI assistance. This finding is compelling because it underscores how AI can elevate work performance, not by replacing human effort but by augmenting it." — EMBA Student, November 2024

20. "As a project manager at GE, Dr. Humphrey's insights into AI offer several practical applications that can enhance both my workflow and my team's productivity." — EMBA Student (GE Project Manager), November 2024

21. "Dr. Humphrey began by demystifying AI and the concept of generative models, explaining how these systems use vast amounts of data to learn, recognize patterns, and produce unique outputs. This foundational knowledge was crucial as it helped me appreciate the underlying mechanisms driving AI tools like ChatGPT." — EMBA Student, November 2024

22. "The session's emphasis on prompting—crafting detailed, context-rich inputs to elicit accurate AI responses—was both practical and insightful. Dr. Humphrey shared various techniques for effective prompting, including the importance of a larger 'context window' and adding specifics to enrich responses." — EMBA Student, November 2024

23. "Jarrod introduced the concept of the 'Hype Cycle,' which is a framework that shows the typical trajectory of new technologies through phases of excitement, disillusionment, and eventual maturity. He noted that AI currently occupies a pivotal position within this cycle, characterized by both significant enthusiasm and a degree of skepticism. This context is crucial for understanding how businesses might approach the adoption of AI technologies." — EMBA Student, November 2024

24. "While I think AI can be incredibly useful, I appreciated Jarrod's comment about being carful to ensure it isn't used to undermine critical thinking. Perhaps this has been some of my hesitation in using it too much in the past. I wouldn't want to become fully reliant on it or have some fear that what it is generating may be untruthful." — EMBA Student, November 2024

25. "Reflecting on the talk provided valuable insights into integrating AI into personal and professional tasks. One key takeaway was the advice to delegate activities that don't add value to my life. By offloading repetitive or mundane duties, I can concentrate on more meaningful activities, ultimately enhancing productivity and personal satisfaction. This aligns perfectly with Jarrod's recommendation to start using AI for 'disposable tasks,' which are routine, low-priority, and quickly discarded after completion." — EMBA Student, November 2024
