Thanks for reaching out. First of all the topic is super cool, but more importantly you teach it with great expertise and passion. I would suspect that you are very well liked by the students that you have the opportunity to share the classroom with.

I do see plenty of opportunity for this technology in our area of retail services and technologies to assist with enhancing our operations, as well as in development of RFPs and contracts that I do a lot of work in as well.

Thanks for all you do for Xavier. Look forward to future collaboration with you.
