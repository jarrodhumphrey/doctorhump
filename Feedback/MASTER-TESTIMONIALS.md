> "Jarrod Humphrey's lecture on artificial intelligence was illuminating and extremely interesting."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

> "I was very much looking forward to Jarrod's presentation, and he did not disappoint! I use AI somewhat regularly in my day-to-day work, and I still feel like I took a few concepts away."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

**Practical Application & Framework:**
> "One thing I found amazing was the four different reasons Jarrod suggested using artificial intelligence: the 'learning luminary,' 'brainstorming buddy,' 'correspondence calculator,' and 'data decoder.' I've used AI for all of these purposes, but have never found such a useful model for describing many of the use cases for AI."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

> "Jarrod's breakdown of AI's 'four friends:' correspondence, idea generation, data analysis, and learning, provided a practical roadmap for different applications."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

**Productivity & Business Value:**
> "One of the most impactful points was how AI can be a significant productivity booster. For instance, the research discussed in the presentation demonstrated how consultants using AI completed tasks faster and with higher quality than those without AI assistance. This finding is compelling because it underscores how AI can elevate work performance, not by replacing human effort but by augmenting it."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

> "As a project manager at GE, Dr. Humphrey's insights into AI offer several practical applications that can enhance both my workflow and my team's productivity."
>
> — EMBA Student (GE Project Manager), November 2024

**Teaching Quality & Engagement:**
> "Dr. Humphrey began by demystifying AI and the concept of generative models, explaining how these systems use vast amounts of data to learn, recognize patterns, and produce unique outputs. This foundational knowledge was crucial as it helped me appreciate the underlying mechanisms driving AI tools like ChatGPT."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

> "The session's emphasis on prompting—crafting detailed, context-rich inputs to elicit accurate AI responses—was both practical and insightful. Dr. Humphrey shared various techniques for effective prompting, including the importance of a larger 'context window' and adding specifics to enrich responses."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

**Hype Cycle & Strategic Thinking:**
> "Jarrod introduced the concept of the 'Hype Cycle,' which is a framework that shows the typical trajectory of new technologies through phases of excitement, disillusionment, and eventual maturity. He noted that AI currently occupies a pivotal position within this cycle, characterized by both significant enthusiasm and a degree of skepticism. This context is crucial for understanding how businesses might approach the adoption of AI technologies."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

> "Jarrod also highlighted the hype cycle stages, noting that we're nearing the peak of inflated expectations and may soon enter a 'trough of disillusionment.' This concept is essential to understand where AI technology currently stands in terms of societal and corporate expectations."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

**Immediate Implementation Plans:**
> "I am using these tools to help me write the synopsis for my reflections. I submit my notes from class and ask the system to generate what I have learned. It takes my notes and reorganizes them into paragraph format. At this point, I can reread the lecture and ensure I have fully understood the guest speaker's presentation."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

> "Currently, I use Chat GPT every single day at least 10 times a day for work. I have Otter summarize meetings and take notes which significantly cuts down on email time. I use it for data analysis as I have access to all the company's sales and underwriting data. I've been able to quickly find the average premium per segment and line of business within a state in a matter of minutes."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

> "My favorite thing I have done with AI is to create a thinktank that allows focus groups to help me think in different ways for problems that arise throughout my day. I have created different 'personalities' that have been saved in the memory of GPT that I can call on at any point to help me sort out a problem. This variety of perspectives has allowed me to think of problems and create the best solutions multiple times since using AI."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

**Professional Context Applications:**

**For Project Management (GE):**
> "As a project manager at GE, Dr. Humphrey's insights into AI offer several practical applications that can enhance both my workflow and my team's productivity. One of the first ways I plan to implement AI is by using it to automate routine project management tasks such as scheduling meetings, creating reports, and tracking progress against project milestones. By leveraging AI to handle these administrative tasks, I will be able to focus more on strategic planning and problem-solving—areas where human insight and creativity are crucial."
>
> — EMBA Student (GE Project Manager), November 2024

**For Food Safety/Quality Assurance:**
> "As the Senior Vice President of Food Safety & Quality Assurance for a private label food manufacturer that does over $1 billion in annual revenue, what ways would you recommend I use ChatGPT or other AI technology to ensure my department stays relevant and ready to tackle obstacles within the food safety and quality space?"
>
> ChatGPT provided 10 specific recommendations including compliance tracking, predictive quality management, supply chain monitoring, root cause investigation, training platforms, feedback analysis, audits, allergen identification, real-time decision support, and market intelligence.
>
> — EMBA Student (SVP Food Safety), November 2024

**Critical Thinking & Balanced Approach:**
> "One thing I would like to do moving forward is to put some guardrails on my own use of AI. I have no doubt that writing and critical thinking are two perishable skills—if you don't use them, you lose them. In the future, AI can be a crutch that limits your ability to do these critical skills for yourself. It's important to challenge yourself from time to time and make sure that you can still walk the walk and talk the talk of thinking and writing."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

> "While I think AI can be incredibly useful, I appreciated Jarrod's comment about being carful to ensure it isn't used to undermine critical thinking. Perhaps this has been some of my hesitation in using it too much in the past. I wouldn't want to become fully reliant on it or have some fear that what it is generating may be untruthful."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

**Learning & Development:**
> "Reflecting on the talk provided valuable insights into integrating AI into personal and professional tasks. One key takeaway was the advice to delegate activities that don't add value to my life. By offloading repetitive or mundane duties, I can concentrate on more meaningful activities, ultimately enhancing productivity and personal satisfaction. This aligns perfectly with Jarrod's recommendation to start using AI for 'disposable tasks,' which are routine, low-priority, and quickly discarded after completion."
>
> — EMBA Student, November 2024

> "A significant concept discussed was 'crossing the chasm,' which highlighted the importance of perseverance in building successful AI integration. Recognizing when we've reached a peak in our endeavors fosters resilience and encourages us to push through challenges. This mindset, combined with AI's expanding role, equips individuals and businesses to navigate the rapidly changing technological landscape with a long-term perspective."

**Tools & Technologies Mentioned by Students:**
- ChatGPT (primary tool, mentioned by most students)
- Claude (specifically mentioned for code generation)
- NotebookLM (knowledge consolidation)
- Google Gemini (data analysis, coding)
- Otter (meeting summarization)
- Microsoft Power Automate (disposable tasks)
- Suno (AI music generator - demonstrated in class)
- Google's GPT tokenizer (context window demonstration)

**Real-World Implementation Examples from Reflections:**

1. **Job Posting Creation:** "One use case I had recently was a job posting. While the job is important and I want to make an accurate and complete description for the job I'm posting for, I don't want to spend several hours wordsmithing the description. Instead, I used my company's internal AI tool to develop the job posting by describing to my company's internal AI—also known as 'Wingmate'—what the person would be expected to do in the role. After the three minutes it took me to think up and type the prompt, I had a fit-for-purpose job description that only took some minor editing to make ready for posting."

2. **Homework Help for Kids:** "One area where using AI has been surprisingly helpful is in re-educating myself on basic skills, like math, to help my kids with their homework. This has been essential in building my confidence while supporting them academically. Rather than spending hours revisiting textbooks or searching scattered resources online, I can turn to ChatGPT for quick, clear explanations of math concepts, practice problems, and step-by-step solutions."

3. **Data Analysis (Insurance):** "I use it for data analysis as I have access to all the company's sales and underwriting data. I've been able to quickly find the average premium per segment and line of business within a state in a matter of minutes. This could take analysts days to scrape and piece data together to get results."

4. **Document Templates:** "I used it to create a template for a document, which I then edited to make it relevant and specific to my work. I also use it to create outlines for presentations, developing communication materials, or drafting project proposals."

5. **Research Assistant:** "I use ChatGPT to answer questions, as it synthesizes information from a wide range of topics in one place. For example, when researching my next car purchase right now. When comparing two models or vehicle options, I can have ChatGPT summarize, compare, and contrast different attributes based on the latest available knowledge."

6. **ESG Reporting:** "I work closely with our ESG team and often have long reports to compare then offer suggestions as to how we could improve our reporting. I feel more confident that the summaries and comparisons I am getting back are accurate."

7. **Programming/DAX (Power BI):** "I have used ChatGPT to help me program DAX and PowerBI dashboards. While ChatGPT went very off course it would only get me on the 20 yard line and I would still have to get it across the goal line. I am going to play with Claude next time I am programming this week."
