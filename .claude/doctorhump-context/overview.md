- Build incrementally
- Launch with basics, enhance over time
- Not trying to be perfect on day 1

### Writing Tone
- **Third person** (not first person "I")
- **Friendly but professional**
- Not too academic/boring
- Not overly marketing-focused
- Unique "Dr. Hump" personality throughout

### Visual Philosophy
- **Not SEO-focused** (at least not initially)
- **Minimal photos** of Jarrod - mostly graphics and text
- **Cool, interesting visuals** that make people say "wow"
- Professional but different from typical academic sites
