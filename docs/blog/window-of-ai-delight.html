        <h1>The Window of AI Delight</h1>

                <strong>doctorhump</strong> & <img src="../claude_author.png" alt="Claude Sonnet 4.5" class="claude-logo">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Six months after ChatGPT launched, I noticed something strange happening in my personal and professional life.</p>

            <p>I'd demonstrate a simple AI workflow—maybe building an agentic automation at work, or creating case studies in class faster and with better quality than ever before—and people would look at me like I'd just performed magic. They'd assume these capabilities belonged to me personally, when in reality, they were shared between me and a tool that anyone could access.</p>

            <p>That's when it hit me: we're living in a rare moment I call <strong>the Window of AI Delight</strong>.</p>

            <p>I learned about delight when I owned a smoothie business. If a regular customer walked from their car to my shop, I'd have my staff make their usual order before they reached the counter. They'd walk in and—surprise!—their smoothie was ready. Free upgrade. Instant joy.</p>

            <p>That's delight: the intersection of joy and surprise. In business and customer service, creating delight is powerful. It builds loyalty, increases satisfaction, and makes people feel genuinely valued. But it requires you to do something unexpected that delivers real value.</p>

            <h2>What Makes This Window Special</h2>

            <p>The tools are breathtakingly powerful. AI can analyze data, generate creative ideas, build automations, create presentations, and solve problems at a level that feels almost alien.</p>

            <p>The tools are surprisingly easy to learn. We're not talking about mastering Python or understanding neural networks. This is "setting up an Outlook calendar" level of technical difficulty. Maybe easier.</p>

            <p>Most people haven't learned them yet. Whether they're nervous about AI, unaware of what's possible, or blocked by employer restrictions, the majority of professionals are still on the sidelines.</p>

            <p>This creates a massive opportunity gap. Right now, if you get to the frontier—if you learn these tools and deploy them effectively—you can create disproportionate value. You can delight yourself, your colleagues, your clients, and your organization.</p>

            <p>When you lean into the Window of AI Delight, you gain capabilities that feel like superpowers: drafting nuanced content in seconds, creating presentations that would've taken hours, analyzing complex datasets without specialized training, brainstorming solutions with a tireless creative partner.</p>

            <p>And here's the crucial part: you shouldn't hide the fact that you used AI. This isn't about faking genius. It's about demonstrating what's possible when humans and AI collaborate. When you show someone a brilliant analysis you co-created with Claude, and they're amazed, that's not deception—that's you being at the frontier and bringing others along with you.</p>

            <p>This window started in 2022 and it's still open right now. But at some point—maybe in 1-3 years—everyone will have caught up. Using AI for these tasks won't be impressive anymore. It'll just be normal. Like knowing how to use Excel or send a calendar invite. The window will close.</p>

            <h2>Make the Most of This Moment</h2>

            <p>This is your opportunity to be a thought leader in your workplace or your school. You can bring joy to yourself and others. My research shows that this AI moment we're in right now is full of two things: excitement and fear. We've over-indexed on AI fear in the world right now—and for good reason. But there's just as much reason to be optimistic and enthusiastic about AI.</p>

            <p>Get to the frontier. Spend time learning one AI tool deeply. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini—pick one and explore it until you understand its capabilities and limitations.</p>

            <p>Use it ethically and effectively. Don't plagiarize. Don't claim sole authorship of co-created work. Be transparent about your process. Use AI to amplify your expertise, not replace your thinking.</p>

            <p>Delight people. When you create something impressive with AI, share it. Show your colleagues what's possible. Teach them how you did it. Multiply the delight across your organization.</p>

            <p>The Window of AI Delight is a time period, and we're in it right now. Let's use it to our advantage. Let's do our best to use AI to increase job satisfaction as much as we can.</p>

            <p>The smoothie is ready. The upgrade is free. The window is open—but it won't stay open forever.</p>

                    <div class="message-content">So I've long had this idea ever since probably six months after Chat GPT was released into the world in the following was the idea basically if you really lean into the AI moment that we're in right now you get to the frontier of AI knowledge and you learn the tools you immediately have these super powers that really are breathtaking right in the beginning it was responding to emails faster than anyone else or it was you know writing better reports or writing you know assignments for my class faster and better for before because you have this you know super intelligent tool this alien life form that's arrived to help your workflow get even more efficient but that really was only available to the people leaning into the moment like you might have missed out on all these super powers if you you know were nervous about using AI or if you simply weren't aware that these tools existed or if your employer you know wouldn't let you use it on your your work computer or something like that So what happened was anytime I would demonstrate these very easy to learn easy to do and easy to execute ideas to those in public that hadn't tried it yet they would be blown away and they would be blown away and they would automatically assume all of these capabilities belonged to me when in reality they were shared between me and the AI tool so it occurred to me that we were in this window where you could really fill people with joy and surprise either by demonstrating the power of these AI tools they would see that the joy and surprise right there or they would react so profoundly to something that you or I have created with AI When in reality it's just like something that's quite a bit basic like it's not that hard to do it's really no harder than like you know setting up an Outlook calendar or something like that you know it's that level of technical ability and even with that low level of technical ability you could really blow people away bring them joy bring them surprise So what I've referred to this window as and I've referred to this to clients that I've consulted with organizations executives MBA students undergrad as I refer to this as the window of AI delight delight meaning joy and surprise you know I used to try to delight my customers when I owned a smoothie business by giving them a free upgrade you know because they were being friendly that day or if I noticed somebody was you know walking to my shop from their car and I knew what their order was they were a regular I would have my staff make it before they even came into the store and they would come up and get this free upgrade or have something made for them ready to go instantly and that would bring them joy and surprise and and that was when I realized the power of delight in business in delight in customer service and really we have something like that going on in AI now we are in a window of AI delight where if you just get to the frontier get to the edge which will take some learning to to learn these tools then you can simply deploy them effectively and if you deploy them effectively around people that haven't had the chance to learn these tools yet they're going to think you are like the most incredible impressive person ever and you shouldn't hide the fact that you used AI you should be proud of the fact you used AI to amplify your capabilities right this is something that is a force multiplier and if you can delight people and multiply that delight across your organization and bring joy to people and increase their job satisfaction by helping them delight themselves with AI tools than you should So what I really want to just convey to the world is that we are in a special time right now all levels of professionals working in business or really any field can on board an AI tool use it ethically and effectively and delight the heck out of themselves and the people around them</div>

And I'm struck by the smoothie shop connection - that's not just an analogy, that's the SAME insight applied to a different context. You saw how delight works in business, and now you're seeing it play out at scale with AI.

Here's what I'm hearing: The window is temporary, right? Like, at some point, everyone will have caught up, and using Claude to draft an email won't be impressive anymore. It'll just be... normal. Like knowing how to use Excel.

But right now, we're in this weird magical moment where:
1. The tools are incredibly powerful
2. They're actually pretty easy to learn
3. Most people haven't learned them yet
4. So you can create disproportionate value/joy/surprise

And your point about NOT hiding the AI usage - that's the ethical backbone of this whole thing. You're not saying "fake being a genius." You're saying "show people what's possible when humans and AI collaborate."

Is the blog post about helping people recognize they're IN this window right now? Like, "hey, you have maybe 1-3 years where this superpower is still surprising - use it wisely"?

Or is it more about teaching people HOW to create delight with AI in their specific contexts?

# The Window of AI Delight (And Why You Should Jump Through It Now)

Six months after ChatGPT launched, I noticed something strange happening in my consulting sessions.

I'd demonstrate a simple AI workflow—maybe using Claude to draft a thoughtful email response, or having it analyze a spreadsheet in seconds—and executives would look at me like I'd just performed magic. They'd assume these capabilities belonged to me personally, when in reality, they were shared between me and a tool that anyone could access.

That's when it hit me: we're living in a rare moment I call **the Window of AI Delight**.

## What Is Delight, Anyway?

I learned about delight when I owned a smoothie business. If a regular customer walked from their car to my shop, I'd have my staff make their usual order before they reached the counter. They'd walk in and—surprise!—their smoothie was ready. Free upgrade. Instant joy.

That's delight: the intersection of joy and surprise.

In business and customer service, creating delight is powerful. It builds loyalty, increases satisfaction, and makes people feel genuinely valued. But it requires you to do something unexpected that delivers real value.

## The AI Delight Window Is Open Right Now

Here's what makes this moment special:

**The tools are breathtakingly powerful.** AI can respond to emails faster and better than most humans. It can write reports, analyze data, generate creative ideas, and solve problems at a level that feels almost alien.

**The tools are surprisingly easy to learn.** We're not talking about mastering Python or understanding neural networks. This is "setting up an Outlook calendar" level of technical difficulty. Maybe easier.

**Most people haven't learned them yet.** Whether they're nervous about AI, unaware of what's possible, or blocked by employer restrictions, the majority of professionals are still on the sidelines.

**This creates a massive opportunity gap.** Right now, if you get to the frontier—if you learn these tools and deploy them effectively—you can create disproportionate value. You can delight yourself, your colleagues, your clients, and your organization.

## The Superpower You Didn't Know You Had

When you lean into the AI moment, you gain capabilities that feel like superpowers:
- Drafting nuanced, thoughtful responses in seconds
- Creating presentation decks that would've taken hours
- Analyzing complex datasets without specialized training
- Brainstorming solutions with a tireless creative partner

And here's the crucial part: **you shouldn't hide the fact that you used AI.**

This isn't about faking genius. It's about demonstrating what's possible when humans and AI collaborate. When you show someone a brilliant analysis you co-created with Claude, and they're amazed, that's not deception—that's you being at the frontier and bringing others along with you.

## Why This Window Won't Stay Open Forever

At some point—maybe in 1-3 years—everyone will have caught up. Using AI to draft emails won't be impressive anymore. It'll just be normal. Like knowing how to use Excel or send a calendar invite.

But right now, we're in the magical interim. The tools exist. They're accessible. And they're still surprising.

## What You Should Do About It

**Get to the frontier.** Spend time learning one AI tool deeply. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini—pick one and explore it until you understand its capabilities and limitations.

**Use it ethically and effectively.** Don't plagiarize. Don't claim sole authorship of co-created work. Be transparent about your process. Use AI to amplify your expertise, not replace your thinking.

**Delight people.** When you create something impressive with AI, share it. Show your colleagues what's possible. Teach them how you did it. Multiply the delight across your organization.

**Recognize the window is temporary.** This isn't a permanent advantage. It's a moment in time when being an early adopter creates disproportionate returns. Use it wisely.

## The Bottom Line

We are in a special time. Professionals at all levels, across all fields, can onboard an AI tool, use it ethically and effectively, and delight themselves and everyone around them.

The smoothie is ready. The upgrade is free. The window is open.

Jump through it.

Six months after ChatGPT launched, I noticed something strange happening in my personal and professional life.

I'd demonstrate a simple AI workflow—maybe building an agentic automation at work, or creating case studies in class faster and with better quality than ever before—and people would look at me like I'd just performed magic. They'd assume these capabilities belonged to me personally, when in reality, they were shared between me and a tool that anyone could access.

# The Window of AI Delight

Six months after ChatGPT launched, I noticed something strange happening in my personal and professional life.

I'd demonstrate a simple AI workflow—maybe building an agentic automation at work, or creating case studies in class faster and with better quality than ever before—and people would look at me like I'd just performed magic. They'd assume these capabilities belonged to me personally, when in reality, they were shared between me and a tool that anyone could access.

That's when it hit me: we're living in a rare moment I call **the Window of AI Delight**.

I learned about delight when I owned a smoothie business. If a regular customer walked from their car to my shop, I'd have my staff make their usual order before they reached the counter. They'd walk in and—surprise!—their smoothie was ready. Free upgrade. Instant joy.

That's delight: the intersection of joy and surprise. In business and customer service, creating delight is powerful. It builds loyalty, increases satisfaction, and makes people feel genuinely valued. But it requires you to do something unexpected that delivers real value.

## What Makes This Window Special

The tools are breathtakingly powerful. AI can analyze data, generate creative ideas, build automations, create presentations, and solve problems at a level that feels almost alien.

The tools are surprisingly easy to learn. We're not talking about mastering Python or understanding neural networks. This is "setting up an Outlook calendar" level of technical difficulty. Maybe easier.

Most people haven't learned them yet. Whether they're nervous about AI, unaware of what's possible, or blocked by employer restrictions, the majority of professionals are still on the sidelines.

This creates a massive opportunity gap. Right now, if you get to the frontier—if you learn these tools and deploy them effectively—you can create disproportionate value. You can delight yourself, your colleagues, your clients, and your organization.

When you lean into the Window of AI Delight, you gain capabilities that feel like superpowers: drafting nuanced content in seconds, creating presentations that would've taken hours, analyzing complex datasets without specialized training, brainstorming solutions with a tireless creative partner.

And here's the crucial part: you shouldn't hide the fact that you used AI. This isn't about faking genius. It's about demonstrating what's possible when humans and AI collaborate. When you show someone a brilliant analysis you co-created with Claude, and they're amazed, that's not deception—that's you being at the frontier and bringing others along with you.

This window started in 2022 and it's still open right now. But at some point—maybe in 1-3 years—everyone will have caught up. Using AI for these tasks won't be impressive anymore. It'll just be normal. Like knowing how to use Excel or send a calendar invite. The window will close.

## Make the Most of This Moment

This is your opportunity to be a thought leader in your workplace or your school. You can bring joy to yourself and others. My research shows that this AI moment we're in right now is full of two things: excitement and fear. We've over-indexed on AI fear in the world right now—and for good reason. But there's just as much reason to be optimistic and enthusiastic about AI.

Get to the frontier. Spend time learning one AI tool deeply. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini—pick one and explore it until you understand its capabilities and limitations.

Use it ethically and effectively. Don't plagiarize. Don't claim sole authorship of co-created work. Be transparent about your process. Use AI to amplify your expertise, not replace your thinking.

Delight people. When you create something impressive with AI, share it. Show your colleagues what's possible. Teach them how you did it. Multiply the delight across your organization.

The Window of AI Delight is a time period, and we're in it right now. Let's use it to our advantage. Let's do our best to use AI to increase job satisfaction as much as we can.

The smoothie is ready. The upgrade is free. The window is open—but it won't stay open forever.
