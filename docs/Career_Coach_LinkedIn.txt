AboutAbout
I am a Career Coach at Xavier University who predominantly assists students within STEM (minus health sciences), government, law, and political industries. I support and guide students to put their best foot forward and achieve well rounded success and goal accomplishment through personalized career development strategies.

I graduated with a Master of Science in Criminal Justice from The University of Cincinnati with a concentration in Crime, Law and Justice in December 2024. 

I graduated from Xavier University in May 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice with three minors: psychology, sociology, and criminalistics. I served as the fundraising chair for Alternative Breaks (2019-2020). I was the president and co-founder of Xavier Inclusion Club (2020-2022) and I was awarded the Kaela Alton mental health advocate award in 2022. My country of origin is Great Britain.

Before taking a job on the academic side of higher education, I worked as an assistant baseball coach at the collegiate level. While the platform has changed, my mission is still focused on student development. At Xavier University we help our students discover their career goals and create action plans to empower their pursuit of success in the classroom and in the work force. Through one on one meetings, classroom discussions, campus events and networking opportunities the students that graduate from Xavier University are confident and prepared to take on the challenges of professional life.
